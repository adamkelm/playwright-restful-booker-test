## 🐛 Discovered API Bugs

### Critical Severity (3 Issues)

#### BUG-001: Date Filtering Completely Broken - Severity: 🔴 Critical

**Tests:**
- `tests/booking/get-booking-ids.spec.ts:130` - "should filter bookings by checkin date"
- `tests/booking/get-booking-ids.spec.ts:190` - "should filter bookings by checkin and checkout dates"  
- `tests/booking/get-booking-ids.spec.ts:225` - "should filter with all parameters"

**Description:**  
The GET `/booking` endpoint's date filtering parameters (`checkin` and `checkout`) do not work correctly. When filtering by dates, the API does not return bookings that match those exact dates, even when combined with other filters.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
// 1. Create a booking with specific dates
const testBooking = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking();
const checkinDate = testBooking.bookingdates.checkin; // e.g., "2025-11-23"

const createResponse = await bookingApi.createBooking(testBooking);
const created = await createResponse.json();
const createdBookingId = created.bookingid;

// 2. Filter by that checkin date
const filterResponse = await bookingApi.getBookingIds({ checkin: checkinDate });
const bookingIds = await filterResponse.json();

// 3. Try to find our booking
const foundBooking = bookingIds.find((b) => b.bookingid === createdBookingId);

// Expected: foundBooking is defined
// Actual: foundBooking is undefined - booking not in results!
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Create booking with checkin `2025-11-23` and checkout `2025-11-26`
- Filter by `?checkin=2025-11-23` should return the booking
- Filter by `?checkin=2025-11-23&checkout=2025-11-26` should return the booking
- Filter with all parameters should return matching booking

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBeDefined()
Received: undefined
```
- Bookings not returned even with exact date match
- Combined filters return empty results
- Date filtering appears completely non-functional

**Impact:**  
**Critical** - Core search feature is completely broken. Users cannot:
- Search for bookings by date
- Find bookings for specific time periods
- Use the API's primary filtering mechanism
- This would severely impact any production system relying on date searches

**Recommendation:**  
Fix the date filtering logic to properly match bookings by checkin/checkout dates. This is a core API feature that must work correctly.

#### BUG-002: Delete Returns 403 Instead of 401 for Auth Failures - Severity: 🔴 Critical

**Tests:**
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:69` - "should reject delete without authentication"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:86` - "should reject delete with invalid token"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:104` - "should reject delete with invalid basic auth"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:120` - "should reject delete with empty token"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:133` - "should reject delete with malformed authorization header"

**Description:**  
The DELETE `/booking/:id` endpoint returns HTTP 403 (Forbidden) instead of HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) when authentication is missing, invalid, or malformed.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
// Create a booking
const bookingData = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking();
const createResponse = await bookingApi.createBooking(bookingData);
const created = await createResponse.json();

// Try to delete without authentication
const deleteResponse = await bookingApi.deleteBooking(created.bookingid);

// Expected: 401 Unauthorized
// Actual: 403 Forbidden
expect(deleteResponse.status()).toBe(401); // FAILS
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return **401 Unauthorized** when:
  - No authentication provided
  - Invalid token provided
  - Invalid basic auth credentials
  - Empty token
  - Malformed Authorization header

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 401
Received: 403
```

**Impact:**  
**Critical** - Incorrect HTTP status codes violate REST API standards:
- **401** means "you need to authenticate" (credentials missing or invalid)
- **403** means "you're authenticated but not authorized" (permission denied)
- This confuses API clients and violates HTTP specification
- Makes debugging authentication issues much harder
- Breaks clients expecting standard HTTP semantics

**Recommendation:**  
Return 401 for authentication failures (missing or invalid credentials) and reserve 403 for authorization failures (authenticated but lacking permissions).

---

#### BUG-003: Update Returns 403 Instead of 401 for Auth Failures - Severity: 🔴 Critical

**Tests:**
- `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:122` - "should reject update without authentication"
- `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:135` - "should reject update with invalid token"
- `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:147` - "should reject update with invalid basic auth credentials"
- `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:162` - "should reject update with empty token"

**Description:**  
Same as BUG-002 but for the PUT `/booking/:id` endpoint. Returns 403 instead of 401 for authentication failures.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const updatedData = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking();
const response = await bookingApi.updateBooking(testBookingId, updatedData);

// Expected: 401 Unauthorized
// Actual: 403 Forbidden
expect(response.status()).toBe(401); // FAILS
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return **401 Unauthorized** for authentication failures
- Same reasoning as BUG-002

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 401
Received: 403
```

**Impact:**  
**Critical** - Same HTTP semantics violation as BUG-002, affects update operations.

**Recommendation:**  
Fix authentication error responses to return correct HTTP status codes per REST standards.

---

### High Severity (14 Issues)

#### BUG-004: Missing Firstname Returns 500 Instead of 400 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:191` - "should reject booking with missing firstname"

**Description:**  
When creating a booking without the required `firstname` field, the API returns HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) instead of HTTP 400 (Bad Request).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const invalidBooking = {
  lastname: "Doe",
  totalprice: 100,
  depositpaid: true,
  bookingdates: {
    checkin: "2024-01-01",
    checkout: "2024-01-05",
  },
};

const response = await request.post(`${baseURL}/booking`, {
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  data: invalidBooking,
});

// Expected: 400 Bad Request
// Actual: 500 Internal Server Error
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should return 400 Bad Request with clear error message indicating missing required field.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 500
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Validation errors should never cause server errors:
- 500 errors indicate server bugs, not client mistakes
- Makes debugging difficult for API consumers
- Poor API design and error handling
- Same issue affects lastname, totalprice, and bookingdates

**Recommendation:**  
Implement proper request validation before processing. Return 400 with descriptive error messages for missing required fields.

---

#### BUG-005: Missing Lastname Returns 500 Instead of 400 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:214` - "should reject booking with missing lastname"

**Description:** Same validation issue as BUG-004 but for missing `lastname` field.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 500
```

**Impact:** **High** - Same as BUG-004, indicates systematic validation problem.

---

#### BUG-006: Missing Totalprice Returns 500 Instead of 400 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:236` - "should reject booking with missing totalprice"

**Description:** Same validation issue as BUG-004 but for missing `totalprice` field.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 500
```

**Impact:** **High** - Same as BUG-004, part of systemic validation failure.

---

#### BUG-007: Missing Bookingdates Returns 500 Instead of 400 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:258` - "should reject booking with missing bookingdates"

**Description:** Same validation issue as BUG-004 but for missing `bookingdates` object.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 500
```

**Impact:** **High** - Completes the pattern of missing validation for all required fields.

**Recommendation for BUG-004 through BUG-007:**  
Implement comprehensive input validation middleware that:
1. Checks for required fields before processing
2. Returns 400 with clear error messages
3. Lists all missing fields in one response
4. Prevents 500 errors from validation failures

---

#### BUG-008: Negative Price Accepted Without Validation - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:277` - "should handle negative price"

**Description:**  
The API accepts negative prices when creating bookings, which violates business logic.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const bookingData = TestDataFactory.generateBookingWithPrice(-100);
const response = await bookingApi.createBooking(bookingData);

// Expected: 400 Bad Request
// Actual: 200 OK - booking created with negative price!
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should reject bookings with negative `totalprice` and return 400 Bad Request.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 200
```
- Booking created successfully with `totalprice: -100`
- No validation on price being positive

**Impact:**  
**High** - Business logic violation:
- Negative prices make no sense in booking systems
- Could cause accounting errors
- May break billing systems
- Indicates lack of business rule validation

**Recommendation:**  
Add validation rule: `totalprice must be >= 0`. Same applies to update operations.

---

#### BUG-009: Checkout Before Checkin Accepted - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:318` - "should handle checkout before checkin"

**Description:**  
The API accepts bookings where checkout date is before checkin date, violating basic business logic.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const bookingData = TestDataFactory.generateBookingWithInvalidDateOrder();
// Example: checkin: "2025-12-01", checkout: "2025-11-15"

const response = await bookingApi.createBooking(bookingData);

// Expected: 400 Bad Request
// Actual: 200 OK - illogical booking created!
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should reject bookings where `checkout < checkin` and return 400 Bad Request.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 200
```
- Booking created with checkout before checkin
- No date logic validation

**Impact:**  
**High** - Critical business rule violation:
- Impossible booking scenario
- Causes confusion in booking systems
- May break date calculations
- Could lead to negative stay durations

**Recommendation:**  
Add date validation: `checkout date must be >= checkin date`. Apply to both create and update operations.

---

#### BUG-010: Empty Firstname Accepted - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:341` - "should handle empty firstname string"

**Description:**  
The API accepts bookings with empty string for `firstname` field, which should be validated as required.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const bookingData = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking({ firstname: "" });
const response = await bookingApi.createBooking(bookingData);

// Expected: 400 Bad Request  
// Actual: 200 OK - booking created with empty name!
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should reject bookings with empty/whitespace-only required fields.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 200
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Data quality issue:
- Creates bookings with no guest name
- Makes bookings unsearchable
- Violates data integrity
- Similar issue likely affects lastname

**Recommendation:**  
Add validation: required string fields must be non-empty after trimming whitespace.

---

#### BUG-011: Delete Non-Existent ID Returns 405 Instead of 404 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Tests:**
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:158` - "should handle delete of non-existent booking ID"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:169` - "should handle negative booking ID"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:178` - "should handle zero booking ID"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:184` - "should handle very large booking ID"
- `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:196` - "should handle string ID in URL"

**Description:**  
When deleting a non-existent booking ID, the API returns HTTP 405 (Method Not Allowed) instead of HTTP 404 (Not Found).

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const nonExistentId = 9999999;
const response = await bookingApi.deleteBooking(nonExistentId, authToken);

// Expected: 404 Not Found
// Actual: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should return **404 Not Found** for:
  - Non-existent booking IDs
  - Negative IDs
  - Zero ID
  - Very large IDs
  - Invalid ID format in URL

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 404
Received: 405
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Wrong HTTP semantics:
- **404** means "resource not found"
- **405** means "method not supported for this endpoint"
- Confuses API clients about why request failed
- Affects error handling logic in client code
- Same issue affects update operations

**Recommendation:**  
Return 404 when resource doesn't exist, regardless of the method used. Check resource existence before method validation.

---

#### BUG-012: Double Deletion Returns 405 Instead of 404 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:213` - "should handle double deletion of same booking"

**Description:**  
When attempting to delete an already-deleted booking (idempotency test), the API returns 405 instead of 404.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
// First deletion - succeeds
const delete1 = await bookingApi.deleteBooking(createdBookingId, authToken);
expect(delete1.status()).toBe(201); // SUCCESS

// Second deletion - same booking already deleted
const delete2 = await bookingApi.deleteBooking(createdBookingId, authToken);

// Expected: 404 Not Found (booking doesn't exist anymore)
// Actual: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should return 404 since booking no longer exists after first deletion.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 404
Received: 405
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Same as BUG-011, wrong HTTP semantics for missing resources.

---

#### BUG-013: Update After Deletion Returns 405 Instead of 404 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/delete-booking.spec.ts:251` - "should not allow update after deletion"

**Description:**  
When attempting to update a deleted booking, the API returns 405 instead of 404.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
// Delete the booking
await bookingApi.deleteBooking(createdBookingId, authToken);

// Try to update deleted booking
const updatedData = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking();
const updateResponse = await bookingApi.updateBooking(
  createdBookingId,
  updatedData,
  authToken
);

// Expected: 404 Not Found
// Actual: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should return 404 since booking doesn't exist.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 404
Received: 405
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Same wrong HTTP semantics pattern as BUG-011 and BUG-012.

**Recommendation for BUG-011 through BUG-013:**  
Fix routing/resource lookup logic to check resource existence BEFORE method validation. Always return 404 for missing resources, not 405.

---

#### BUG-014: Update Non-Existent ID Returns 405 Instead of 404 - Severity: 🔴 High

**Test:** `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:176` - "should reject update for non-existent booking ID"

**Description:**  
When updating a non-existent booking ID, the API returns 405 instead of 404.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const updatedData = TestDataFactory.generateValidBooking();
const nonExistentId = 9999999;

const response = await bookingApi.updateBooking(
  nonExistentId,
  updatedData,
  authToken
);

// Expected: 404 Not Found
// Actual: 405 Method Not Allowed
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should return 404 for non-existent resources.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 404
Received: 405
```

**Impact:**  
**High** - Part of systematic 404 vs 405 confusion throughout the API.

---

### Medium Severity (12 Issues)

#### BUG-015: Update Accepts Negative Price - Severity: 🟠 Medium

**Test:** `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:218` - "should handle negative price in update"

**Description:**  
Similar to BUG-008, but for update operations. API accepts negative prices when updating bookings.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const bookingData = TestDataFactory.generateBookingWithPrice(-100);
const response = await bookingApi.updateBooking(testBookingId, bookingData, authToken);

// Expected: 400 Bad Request
// Actual: 200 OK - negative price accepted
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should reject updates with negative prices.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 200
```

**Impact:**  
**Medium** - Same business logic violation as BUG-008 but for update operations.

**Recommendation:**  
Apply same validation rules to updates as to creates. Validate `totalprice >= 0`.

---

#### BUG-016: Update Accepts Invalid Date Order - Severity: 🟠 Medium

**Test:** `tests/booking/update-booking.spec.ts:234` - "should handle checkout before checkin in update"

**Description:**  
Similar to BUG-009 but for update operations. API accepts updates where checkout is before checkin.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

```typescript
const invalidData = TestDataFactory.generateBookingWithInvalidDateOrder();
const response = await bookingApi.updateBooking(testBookingId, invalidData, authToken);

// Expected: 400 Bad Request
// Actual: 200 OK - illogical dates accepted
```

**Expected Behavior:** Should reject updates with checkout before checkin.

**Actual Behavior:**
```
Error: expect(received).toBe(expected)
Expected: 400
Received: 200
```

**Impact:**  
**Medium** - Same business rule violation as BUG-009 but for updates.

**Recommendation:**  
Apply same date validation to updates. Ensure `checkout >= checkin`.

## 🛠️ Test Approach and Strategy

### Framework Choice Justification

Selected **Playwright Test** for API testing for the following reasons:

1. **Modern API Testing**: Excellent support for REST API testing with built-in request context
2. **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support with strong typing
3. **Parallel Execution**: Fast test execution with built-in parallelization (4 workers)
4. **Rich Assertions**: Comprehensive assertion library with auto-waiting and retry
5. **Excellent Reporting**: Built-in HTML reports, JSON output, and trace viewer
6. **Active Development**: Regular updates and strong community support
7. **Page Object Model**: Easy implementation of POM pattern for APIs with fixtures

### Test Organization

- **API Layer** (`api/`): Page Object Models for Auth, Booking, and Ping endpoints with reusable methods
- **Fixtures** (`fixtures/api-fixtures.ts`): Custom test fixtures for dependency injection of API clients
- **Test Suites** (`tests/`): Organized by endpoint and operation (auth, booking CRUD, ping, e2e)
- **Type Safety** (`types/booking.types.ts`): Strong TypeScript interfaces for all API contracts
- **Utilities** (`utils/`): Validators for schema validation, test data factory for dynamic data, constants for configuration

### Test Coverage Strategy

1. **Authentication Testing**: Token creation, invalid credentials, missing fields, security testing
2. **CRUD Operations**: Complete coverage of Create, Read, Update, Delete for bookings
3. **Happy Path Testing**: Verify all operations work with valid data
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Validate error handling, missing fields, invalid data
5. **Edge Case Testing**: Boundary values, special characters, SQL injection attempts
6. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete booking lifecycle workflows
7. **Idempotency Testing**: Verify repeated operations behave correctly
8. **Concurrent Operations**: Test multiple bookings created/modified simultaneously
9. **Filter Testing**: Validate all query parameter combinations
10. **Security Testing**: SQL injection, XSS attempts, authentication bypass attempts

### Test Data Approach

- **Dynamic Generation**: Faker.js for realistic, unique test data
- **Date Handling**: Generate future dates, past dates, invalid date orders
- **Boundary Testing**: Minimum values, maximum values, negative values, empty strings
- **Invalid Data**: Generate invalid scenarios for negative testing
- **Flexible Overrides**: Factory methods accept partial overrides for specific test scenarios

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Priority (Critical)

1. **Fix Date Filtering (BUG-001)**
   - Impact: Core search feature completely broken
   - Effort: Medium - likely database query issue
   - Timeline: Immediate - blocks any date-based search functionality

2. **Fix HTTP Status Codes (BUG-002, BUG-003)**
   - Impact: Violates REST standards, confuses API clients
   - Effort: Low - change response codes in error handlers
   - Timeline: Immediate - standard compliance issue

3. **Implement Input Validation (BUG-004 through BUG-010)**
   - Impact: 500 errors for validation failures, business logic violations
   - Effort: Medium - add validation layer before processing
   - Timeline: High priority - prevents server errors from client mistakes

### Short-Term Priority (High)

4. **Fix Resource Not Found Responses (BUG-011 through BUG-014)**
   - Impact: Wrong HTTP semantics (405 vs 404)
   - Effort: Low - fix routing/resource lookup order
   - Timeline: Should be fixed soon - affects error handling throughout API

5. **Add Business Rule Validation**
   - Validate negative prices are rejected
   - Validate date order (checkout >= checkin)
   - Validate required fields are non-empty
   - Apply same validation rules to both create and update

### Medium-Term Priority

6. **Improve Error Messages**
   - Return descriptive error messages for validation failures
   - List all validation errors in one response
   - Follow standard error response format (e.g., RFC 7807)

7. **Add API Documentation**
   - Document expected error responses for each endpoint
   - Provide examples of valid/invalid requests
   - Document business rules and constraints

8. **Performance Optimization**
   - Fix date filtering queries
   - Add database indexes if needed
   - Optimize concurrent request handling
